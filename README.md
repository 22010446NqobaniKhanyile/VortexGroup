# VortexGroup
Vortex is embarking on developing a maintenance system for the Durban University of Technology (DUT). This  system will allow users to report and update activities that require fixing, such as building repair, landscaping, and  any other item within the University that needs maintenance. The institution is in Durban via Steve Biko Road.
